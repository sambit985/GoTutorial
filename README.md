# Go Learning Guide

This repository covers various fundamental concepts in Go programming, including arrays, slices, error handling, control structures, and more. Below are explanations and examples for each topic.

## Function

💥 **Function in Go** 💥

Functions are a core concept in Go. They allow you to encapsulate code logic into reusable blocks. Functions can take parameters and return values.

### Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func main() {
    sum := add(3, 4)
    fmt.Println("Sum:", sum)
}
```

## If-Else

💥 **If-Else condition in Go** 💥

Conditional statements in Go allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. The if-else statement is one such control structure.

### Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    number := 5
    if number%2 == 0 {
        fmt.Println(number, "is even")
    } else {
        fmt.Println(number, "is odd")
    }
}
```

## Switch

💥 **Switch Statement in Go** 💥

The switch statement in Go is a multi-way branch statement that provides an efficient way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of an expression.

### Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    day := "Monday"
    switch day {
    case "Monday":
        fmt.Println("Start of the workweek!")
    case "Friday":
        fmt.Println("Almost weekend!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Midweek day.")
    }
}
```

## User Input

💥 **User input read in Go** 💥

Go provides ways to capture user input from the command line using various packages like bufio and fmt.

### Example:

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("What's your name?")
    reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
    name, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
    fmt.Println("Hello,", name)
}
```

## Array

💥 **Array in Go** 💥

An array is a collection of elements of the same type with a fixed size. In Go, arrays are declared with a specific size and can hold elements of a specified type. Arrays are useful when you know the number of elements you need to store.

### Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var arr [5]int
    arr[0] = 10
    arr[1] = 20
    arr[2] = 30
    arr[3] = 40
    arr[4] = 50

    fmt.Println("Array elements:", arr)
}
```

## Slice

💥 **Slice in Go** 💥

A slice is a more flexible alternative to an array. Unlike arrays, slices can grow and shrink in size. Slices are references to an underlying array and provide more powerful and convenient operations.

### Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    fmt.Println("Slice elements:", numbers)

    // Append a new element to the slice
    numbers = append(numbers, 6)
    fmt.Println("After append:", numbers)
}
```

## Error Handling

💥 **Error Handling in Go** 💥

Error handling in Go is done using the built-in error type. Functions that might fail return an error value, which should be checked to handle any potential issues.

### Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func division(a, b float64) (float64, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("denominator must not be 0")
    }
    return a / b, nil
}

func main() {
    result, err := division(10, 0)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Result:", result)
    }
}
```

## For Loop

💥 **For Loop in Go** 💥

The for loop is the only loop construct in Go. It can be used in various ways, such as iterating over elements, running an operation a fixed number of times, or looping indefinitely.

### Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        fmt.Println("Element at index", i, ":", numbers[i])
    }
}
```

## Maps

🗺️ **Maps in Go** 🗺️

In Go, maps are an essential data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data in key-value pairs. They provide a way to quickly access values based on unique keys. Maps are similar to dictionaries in Python or hash tables in other languages.

### Why Use Maps?

- **Fast Lookups**: Maps provide efficient key-based access, making it fast to retrieve data.
- **Dynamic Size**: Maps are dynamic in size, meaning they can grow and shrink as needed.
- **Flexibility**: Keys and values can be of different types, allowing for versatile data storage.

#### Creating a Map

You can create a map using the `make` function or by declaring it directly:

### Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Creating a map using make
    studentGrades := make(map[string]int)

    // Creating a map with initial values
    studentAges := map[string]int{
        "Alice": 20,
        "Bob":   22,
    }

    fmt.Println("Student Grades:", studentGrades)
    fmt.Println("Student Ages:", studentAges)
}
```

## Structs

🧩 **Structs in Go** 🧩

In Go, maps are an essential data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data in key-value pairs. They provide a way to quickly access values based on unique keys. Maps are similar to dictionaries in Python or hash tables in other languages.

### Why Use Structs?

- **Organized Data**: Structs help in organizing related data under one type, making the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Custom Data Types**: Structs allow you to define your own data types that represent specific entities, making your code more expressive.
- **Methods**: You can associate methods with structs, encapsulating both data and behavior together.

#### Defining a Struct

You define a struct in Go using the type keyword, followed by the struct name and the list of fields.

### Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining a struct for a Person
type Person struct {
    Name   string
    Age    int
    Gender string
}

func main() {
    // Creating an instance of the struct
    p1 := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30, Gender: "Female"}

    // Accessing and modifying fields
    fmt.Println("Name:", p1.Name)
    fmt.Println("Age:", p1.Age)
    fmt.Println("Gender:", p1.Gender)

    p1.Age = 31
    fmt.Println("Updated Age:", p1.Age)
}
```

## Pointers

🔗 **Pointers in Go** 🔗

In Go, pointers are a powerful feature that allow you to work with memory addresses directly. They enable you to reference and modify values stored in memory, making your programs more efficient and flexible.

### Why Use Pointers?

- **Efficiency**: Pointers allow you to pass references to values rather than copying entire data structures, which can be more efficient, especially with large structs or arrays.
- **Modify Values**: Pointers give you the ability to modify the original value of a variable from different parts of your code, which is essential in many scenarios like implementing functions that update or manipulate data.
- **Memory Management**: Pointers provide fine-grained control over memory, allowing you to optimize your application's performance and resource usage.

### Defining and Using Pointers

You define a pointer in Go by using the \* symbol. The & symbol is used to obtain the memory address of a variable.

### Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Defining an integer variable
    var x int = 10

    // Creating a pointer to the variable x
    var p *int = &x

    // Accessing the value of x through the pointer
    fmt.Println("Value of x:", *p)

    // Modifying the value of x through the pointer
    *p = 20
    fmt.Println("Updated value of x:", x)

    // Showing the address stored in the pointer
    fmt.Println("Pointer address:", p)
}
```

## Strings Package

🔗 **String Manipulation in Go** 🔗

Go provides a rich set of built-in functions for working with strings, making it easy to perform various operations such as searching, splitting, joining, and modifying strings. The strings package in Go is a powerful tool for developers who need to handle text processing efficiently.

### Importing the strings Package

Before you can use the string functions, you need to import the strings package:

```go
import "strings"
```

### Commonly Used String Functions

### 1. Contains

```go
strings.Contains("hello world", "world") // Returns: true
```

### 2.HasPrefix

```go
strings.HasPrefix("hello world", "hello") // Returns: true
```

### 3.Index

```go
strings.Index("hello world", "world") // Returns: 6
```

### 4.Join

```go
strings.Join([]string{"hello", "world"}, ", ") // Returns: "hello, world"
```

### 5.Split

```go
strings.Split("a,b,c", ",") // Returns: ["a", "b", "c"]
```

### 6.Replace

```go
strings.Replace("hello world", "world", "Go", 1) // Returns: "hello Go"
```

### 7.ToLower

```go
strings.ToLower("HELLO WORLD") // Returns: "hello world"
```

### 8.Count

```go
strings.Count("hello world", "l") // Returns: 3
```

### 9.Compare

```go
strings.Compare("a", "b") // Returns: -1
```

### 10.Repeat

```go
strings.Repeat("Go ", 3) // Returns: "Go Go Go "
```

## File Operations

**String Manipulation in Go**

This document provides an overview of file operations in Go, including reading from and writing to files. Go's `os` and `io/ioutil` packages offer robust functionality for handling files.

### Table of Contents

- [Writing Files](#writing-files)
- [Appending to Files](#appending-to-files)
- [File Operations Best Practices](#file-operations-best-practices)

### Reading Files

1. **Using `ioutil.ReadFile`**
   To read a file in Go, you can use the `os` and `ioutil` packages. Below is an example of reading a file using `ioutil.ReadFile`:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile("example.txt")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to read file: %v", err)
    }
    fmt.Println("File Content:\n", string(data))
}
```

2. **Using `os.Open` and `io`**

To read file ioutil.ReadFile() or os.ReadFile() is not good aproach in case of large file beacuse it is taking whole data at a time then putting in to memory so this way is good:-

```go
package main
import ("fmt", "io")
func main(){
//open the file
    file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
    if err != nil{
        fmt.Println("Error while opening file", err)
        return
    }

    defer file.Close()

    //create buffer slice to store byte data
    buffer := make([]byte, 1024)

    //Read the file and store the byte data in buffer[]
    for{
        n, error := file.Read(buffer)
        //read the file untill end of file
        if error == io.EOF{
            break
        }
        if error != nil{
            fmt.Println("Error while read the file", error)
            return
        }

    }
        //read the buffer[] data
        fmt.Println("File content is:", string(buffer[:n]))
}
```

### Writing Files

To write data to a file, use the os package's Create or OpenFile methods. Here is an example using os.Create:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    file, err := os.Create("example.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to create file: %v", err)
        return
    }
    defer file.Close()

    _, err = file.WriteString("Hello, World!")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to write to file: %v", err)
    }
}
```

### Key Points

- **file.WriteString** : Writes data to the file.
- **defer file.Close()** :Ensures the file is closed after operations are complete.
- **os.Create** :Creates a new file or truncates an existing file.

### File Operations Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Always check and handle errors to ensure robustness.
- **File Closing**: Use defer to close files to prevent resource leaks.
- **Permissions**: Set appropriate file permissions based on your application's requirements.
- **Buffering**: For large files or frequent operations, consider using buffered I/O for efficiency.

## Goroutines in Go 
Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. Unlike traditional threads, goroutines are extremely efficient, allowing thousands or even millions of goroutines to run concurrently. They enable concurrent execution of functions, making Go highly effective for parallel and concurrent programming.

### Creating Goroutines
You can create a goroutine by prefixing a function or method call with the go keyword. This starts a new goroutine that runs concurrently with the calling function.
However, the main function exits immediately, so we use time.Sleep() to give the goroutine time to finish.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine!")
    time.Sleep(1000 * time.MiliSecond)
}
func sayHi(){
    fmt.Println("Hii")
}
func main() {
    // Start a goroutine
    go sayHello()
    go sayHi()

    // Ensure the main function waits before exiting
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}
```
